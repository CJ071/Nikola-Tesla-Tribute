<h2>Here's timeline of Nikola Tesla</h2>

<ul>
<li><span class="bold">July 10, 1856</span>-Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His parents were ethnic Serbians. His father was an Orthodox Priest, and he credited his mother for his inventiveness.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1875 </span> - Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees</li>
<li><span class="bold">1882</span> - he went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1882</span> - Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1884</span> - Moved to United States 
        Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1885</span> - After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1886</span> - Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1887</span> - The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1891</span> - In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1891</span> - With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.
</li>
<li><span class="bold">1901</span> - In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.
</li>
<li><span class="bold">August 4, 1915</span> -  August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.
</li>
<li><span class="bold">1934</span> - In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1943</span> - On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.
</li>
<li><span class="bold">1960</span> - In 1960, the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.</li>
</ul>
<p>Einstein was once asked what it was like to be the smartest man alive. He replied </p>

“I don't know, you'll have to ask Nikola Tesla.”</p>
